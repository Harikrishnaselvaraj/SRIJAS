|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 0| Not yet implemented|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 2|The demo video shows this (https://github.com/ineelshah/SRIJAS/blob/main/README.md)|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 3| The demo video and repository homepage (README) shows this (https://github.com/ineelshah/SRIJAS/blob/main/README.md)|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3 | SRIJAS_DEMO.mp4 as attached in the README.md in the repository. (https://github.com/ineelshah/SRIJAS/blob/main/README.md)|
| Use of version control tools| 3| Git is used thorougly in the project (https://github.com/ineelshah/SRIJAS)|
| Use of  style checkers |3 |config files in GH showing your config (https://github.com/ineelshah/SRIJAS/blob/main/.github/workflows/style_checker.yml)|
| Use of code  formatters. | 3|config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config (https://github.com/ineelshah/SRIJAS/blob/main/.github/workflows/code_formatter.yml)|
| Use of syntax checkers| 3 |config files in  GH showing this checker's config (https://github.com/ineelshah/SRIJAS/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)|

| test cases exist| 2| a lot of test cases exist but not covering all the functionalities. To be added soon.|
| test cases are routinely executed| 2| Github actions and travis CI both are conducting regular tests.|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3| |
| issues are discussed before they are closed| 3| Most discussions on whatsapp, in person, on issue comments, and over calls.|
| Chat channel: exists| 3| Whatsapp chat channel exists.|
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|2 |if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3| |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3| |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3| |
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3| |
| short release cycles |  3||
